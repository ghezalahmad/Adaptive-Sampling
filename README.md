# ADAPTIVE UPSCALING APPROACH FOR ASSESSING MATERIALSâ€™ CIRCULARITY POTENTIAL WITH NON-DESTRUCTIVE TESTING (NDT)

This is an introduces an innovative AI-driven adaptive sampling technique combined with Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) to address this challenge. Adaptive sampling, a method that selectively targets the most informative data points, is particularly suited to NDT due to its potential to reduce the volume of data required for accurate assessments significantly. Our method substantially demonstrates a remarkable reduction in data requirements, with an average reduction of just 7 samples for Logistic Regression and 8 for Random Forest, when paired with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). These numbers reflect a tangible improvement over traditional random sampling, which needed an average of 29 samples. This efficiency is achieved through the application of advanced machine learning algorithms to enable a dynamic, iterative sampling process that intelligently adapts to the complexity of the structural data being analyzed. The application of this adaptive sampling approach in detecting pitting corrosion within reinforced concrete slabs highlights its effectiveness. By reducing the necessity for extensive data collection, our method not only streamlines the assessment process but also significantly contributes to the sustainability goals of the circular economy by promoting infrastructure longevity. ![as-result](https://github.com/ghezalahmad/Adaptive-Sampling-/assets/1660323/940af0e1-b77f-411a-b00a-4639a762920c)
